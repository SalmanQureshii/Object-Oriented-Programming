Student Management System (C++)

A console-based Student Management System developed in C++ to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and file handling concepts. The project simulates a basic academic record system with separate roles for administrators and students, focusing on clean structure, data persistence, and logical flow.

Features

Admin and Student login system

Add, update, search, and delete student records

View students grouped by department and enrollment year

Persistent storage using file handling (fstream)

Simple menu-driven console interface

Concepts & Technologies Used

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Inheritance (Person → Student → AcademicRecord)

Polymorphism (virtual functions)

Encapsulation (private data members with getters/setters)

STL Containers (vector, algorithm)

File Handling (read/write student records to text files)

Input validation and menu control

Basic data abstraction and modular design

Purpose

This project was built for learning and academic practice, focusing on applying theoretical OOP concepts in a practical, real-world–style C++ application.

Future Improvements

Better input validation and error handling

Sorting and filtering records

Improved authentication and security

GUI-based interface

Clean, structured, and beginner-friendly — ideal for understanding how larger C++ programs are organized.
